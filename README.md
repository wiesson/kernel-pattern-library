Nest – modular CSS framework
============================

Nest is FutureLearn's CSS architecture and framework for building harmonious web interfaces with modular design, and with function in mind. The framework is part of Flock, FutureLearn's design system.


## How is it useful?

It gives you a tested, robust approach, and a starting point with a handful of tools to build modular user interfaces with HTML and CSS.


## Nest reflects our approach to design:

*   Function is at the core of all components, and it defines how the
    UI is presented.
*   We follow a modular design approach what is inspired by Atomic Design
    (besides others, like BEM, SMACSS, OOCSS and ITCSS), but don't
    follow it strictly. Often we prefer thinking in modules (atoms) and groups of modules (molecules or organisms). We also separate function and structure from presentation, and make grouping with function in mind. Modules connect together to serve the goal of a larger module they form.
*   The core visual style of the interface is separated into a system we call
    Core Patterns. These patterns are key visual components for modules – font size scale, spacing units, colour palette, border styles, etc. The Core Pattern system helps making visual connections between modules, and it makes the presentation coherent and harmonious.
*   Design and code is the two sides of the same thing.
