Nest is FutureLearn's CSS architecture and framework for building harmonious web interfaces with modular design, and with function in mind. The framework is part of Flock, FutureLearn's design system.


## How is it useful?

It gives you a tested, robust approach, and a starting point with a handful of tools to build modular user interfaces with HTML and CSS.


## Nest reflects our approach to design:

*   Function is at the core of all components, and it defines how the
    UI is presented.
*   We follow a modular design approach what is inspired by Atomic Design
    (besides others, like BEM, SMACSS, OOCSS and ITCSS), but don't
    follow it strictly. Often we prefer thinking in modules (atoms) and groups of modules (molecules or organisms). We also separate function and structure from presentation, and make grouping with function in mind. Modules connect together to serve the goal of a larger module they form.
*   The core visual style of the interface is separated into a system we call
    Core Patterns. These patterns are key visual components for modules â€“ font size scale, spacing units, colour palette, border styles, etc. The Core Pattern system helps making visual connections between modules, and it makes the presentation coherent and harmonious.
*   Design and code is the two sides of the same thing.


## What problems does it solve?












## What is the name of the project?

Flock Design Sytem


## What is Flock?

It is a design system
It is a methodology to design and development
It is a front end framework

Flock is a modular design system we implemented at FutureLearn.
This repo is the essence of the CSS framework.


## What can I do with it?

*   It gives you a CSS architecture and development method for your
    modular UI project
*   Gives you a starting point.
*   A handful of useful tools to start with.
*   It helps to understand the design approach through code.


## What are the separable components?

Design approach
Design process
CSS architecture (folders, layers, modules with BEM, abstractions)
Core patterns
Templates
Prototyping and pattern library with Middleman
Tests


## Notes

*   Responsive development
*   Progressive enhancement
*   Mobile first
*   DRY
*   Object oriented approach
*   Atomic Design, BEM, SMACSS, OOCCS, ITCSS and others
