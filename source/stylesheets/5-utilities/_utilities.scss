// What are these?
// ---------------
//
// The "utilities" layer is the last layer in our CSS structure. Here we can
// define simle presentational styles, like `.centered` to set
// `text-align: center` on the element. Since these rules are applied after
// everything else, they should overwrite lower level settings. This is the
// only place where it is legal to use the `!important` directive.


.u-centered {
  text-align: center;
}

.u-relative {
  position: relative;
}
